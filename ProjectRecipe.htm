<h2>CHICKEN BIRYANI</h2>
<p><center>
1 ½ cups aged basmathi rice (soaked for 20 to 30 mins, drain and set aside)
½ kg or 1 lb bone-in-chicken or boneless
¼ to ½ tsp. biryani masala powder for sprinkling in between layers
Fried onions from 1 large onion (Learn to make Fried Onions for Hyderabadi Recipes )
Fistful of finely chopped coriander leaves
Fistful of finely chopped mint leaves
2 to 3 tbsp. Sunflower oil or ghee
¼ tsp saffron strands soaked in 3 tbsps. hot milk
Marination for hyderabadi chicken biryani recipe
1 tbsp. ginger garlic paste
¼ tsp turmeric
3 green chilies slit (adjust to suit your taste)
½ cup + 1 tbsp. yogurt / curd
2 tbsps. Lemon juice (adjust)
1 ½ tsp Kashmiri / byadgi red chili powder
½ tsp biryani masala powder
¼ tsp green cardamom powder
Salt to taste
Dry Spices for rice
2 ½ cups water
1 tsp oil
2 small strands of mace
1 large or 2 small black cardamom
4 green cardamom
3” cinnamon stick
6 cloves
1 large or 2 small bay leaf
½ tsp pepper corn
½ tsp shahi jeera / caraway seeds
Instructions
Marinate the chicken with the ingredients mentioned under marination and set aside for at least 2 hrs and overnight is best.
This step is optional. Tie up all the dry spices for rice in a muslin cloth.
Wash rice till the water runs clear. Soak for 20 to 30 minutes. Heat 2 ½ cups water in a utensil to cook rice. Add 1 tsp oil, dry spices and salt, let the water boil rapidly for 5 mins, this way the aroma released is best. Add the soaked rice and cook till it is ¾ done. Remember this is very important. Do not make the rice mushy. Drain off if any excess water is left.
While the rice cooks, transfer the marinated chicken to a heavy bottom casserole, handi or non-stick. Add fried onions, green chilies, ½ of the mint, coriander leaves and pour in the oil or melted ghee. Mix well and level the surface.
Layer the cooked rice evenly, add fried onions, mint and coriander leaves over the chicken.
Sprinkle ¼ tsp to ½ tsp. biryani masala powder.
Repeat steps of layering rice, coriander mint leaves and then fried onions.
Pour the saffron milk all over.
Cover the rim of the casserole with foil to trap the dum or use a cloth. Rinse a thick kitchen cloth and squeeze off the excess water, it must be just moist and not with dripping water. Make a double layer. Spread this cloth over the rim and cover the lid over the casserole.
Place this over a thick hot tawa, set the flame to medium high such that the flame reaches all over the diameter of the casserole. Cook this way for exactly 20 mins. After 20 mins, if you have a see thru lid you can see the vapour filled.
Now reduce the flame to min (as low as in Indian stoves or burners, where the flame barely touches tawa). Cook this way for exactly 10 to 15 mins. You can see the vapour dripping on the moist cloth. Off the flame and leave it as it is for at least 20 to 30 mins. Garnish chicken biryani and serve.

<h2>LAMB BIRYANI</h2>
<p><center>
2 cup of aged basmathi rice (soaked for 20 mins)
3 cups water
¾ cup onions sliced thinly
2 to 4 green chilies
½ cup of tomatoes (adjust as per your desire)
1 tsp. garam masala powder
¼ cup of mint leaves / pudina
¼ cup of coriander leaves
3 tbsp. Oil (do not reduce)
dry spices (for seasoning)
1 large or 2 small bay leaves
½ small nutmeg
2 strands of mace
¾ tsp shahi jeera / black cumin
6 green cardamoms
1 black cardamom
1 star anise
Few pepper corn
3 inch cinnamon stick
6 to 8 cloves
Marination
½ kg of tender lamb mutton (cut to a size of your choice)
¾ tsp red chili powder
1 ½ to 2 tsp. garam masala powder
1 ½ tbsp. ginger garlic paste
¼ tsp turmeric powder
1 cup fresh yogurt (do not use a sour one, can make your rice very sour as we are using tomatoes too)
1 tbsp.oil (oil helps to make the mutton soft)
Salt little
Instructions
Wash rice and soak for 20 minutes. Drain it completely to a colander and set aside
Wash mutton and drain water thoroughly and marinate with marination ingredients and set aside for at least an hour.
Heat a wide pressure pan or non-stick with oil, add the dry spices, sauté till they begin to sizzle.
Add onions, green chilies and fry till they turn brown almost about to caramelize. This is crucial to get a good aroma and taste. There must be enough oil to for the onions to fry.
Add tomatoes, sprinkle salt just enough for the tomatoes to cook easily. Cook till the tomatoes turn fully mushy and the raw smell goes off.
Add half of the coriander and mint leaves, sauté for a min.
Add the marinated mutton pieces, mix well and saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Cook covered on a low flame till the mutton turns soft and tender or cook for 3 whistles in a pressure cooker. Switch off the stove. If cooking in the pan without pressure cooker, stir occasionally to prevent burning. Remember the flame has to be very low otherwise mutton may turn hard. When the pressure goes off, remove the lid. You will be left with a thick gravy. How thick depends on your mutton. If you are left with lot of watery gravy, then evaporate it by cooking for some time.
Add mint, coriander leaves and garam masala. Saute till the good smell of mint and masala comes out. Pour water, bring to a boil. add rice. Adjust salt and cook on a medium flame till almost all the water is evaporated.
Cover and cook till the rice is fully done. If the rice is under cooked and there is not enough moisture, you can sprinkle some water. Alternately you can close the lid of the pressure pan / cooker and cook on a very low flame for just 5 mins. The flame must barely touch the surface of the pan. Do not let the cooker whistle. Alternately you can move the pan on to a old hot tawa. Set the flame to medium and let it cook that way for 10 mins. This way the biryani is not burnt at the bottom.
